<!-- Release-notes skeleton. Entries accumulate in ./Changelog.md as PRs land;
     before publishing a release, distill them:
     - user-visible changes only — no dev tooling, CI fixes, or refactors whose
       effect is already covered by another entry
     - describe outcomes, not internals: no internal module names, IPC or
       protocol details, or implementation mechanics — write what the user
       observes, not how the code achieves it
     - one line per theme: merge entries that share a root cause
     - each entry fits a single readable line (about 60 CJK characters); if it
       overflows, it is packing multiple themes or detail that belongs in the
       linked issue/PR — split it or drop the detail
     - line grammar: open with a verb (修复/新增/优化), with the platform
       first (Windows/macOS/Linux) when the change is platform-specific;
       merge sub-symptoms as 主题：症状、症状; full-width punctuation,
       「」 for UI labels, backticks for config keys and commands
     - platform entries sit under their platform heading (bold, emoji
       prefixed, ordered Windows/macOS/Linux, combined for pairs like
       macOS/Linux) at the end of their section;
       scripts-workflow/group_platforms.sh regroups, --check verifies
     HTML comments are stripped by the update dialog's sanitizer and hidden on
     GitHub, so they never reach users. -->
